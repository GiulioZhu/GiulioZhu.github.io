This is my first game developed with Unity. It's made up of 5 levels, each level getting progressively hard [still need to be implemented]. It provides some basic UIs and animations.

Some flaws: 
- When the player crashes to the side wall, it slows down. This allows an easier gameplay.
- When the player crashes into an obstacle, the level is set to replay by default, not allowing the user to freely exit the level.
