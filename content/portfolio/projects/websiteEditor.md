Currently I'm a part-time Website Editor for "Italian Chinese Theological Seminary" (ICTS).

To be honest, Web editing with a third-party software isn't that complex. They have a vast array of built-in themes and content to choose from. However, the application of such features and elegant design of sites requires hands-on experience and creativity.

Currently, I'm part of a team of 3 people (me included) made up of 2 website editors & 1 content provider. The provider would explain his ideas and we, as editors, would implement them with creativity and fit it organically onto the website. Working in such a small team allows me to improve on my collaborative skills, as well as taking intiatives to propose ideas, test them, and, if approved publish them accordingly. 

I would consider this job as my side project to hone my creativity skill as well as my ability to cooperate in a team environment.
