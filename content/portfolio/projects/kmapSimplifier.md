This is one of the projects done in group for our module <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/design-and-professional-skills-i-computer-science-ENGF0034" target="_blank">ENGF0002</a>.

I dealt with the frontend, which is a Java Swing UI, while the backend is done by my teammate <a href="https://github.com/GrayratA" target="_blank">Holden Li</a>.

In our project we went through a lot, which I'll explain in my [post](../../post/2ManSquad.md).
