> `“We struggle to close the feedback loop on issues in real-time. We need to increase our transparency and accountability to our stakeholders and be responsive to issues they raise quickly.” -Oxfam GB`

This project tackles Oxfam's **Accountability** problem in terms of **transparency and accountability** to stakeholders and **responsiveness to real-time issues**.

> `“Any technical solution would need to consider ease of use, accessibility and scalability, as well as the reality of survey fatigue.” -Oxfam GB`

Our solution simply implements NLP (Natural Language Processing) to process web forms. Generally, the forms are filled by either local partners or regional operators, and can be either filled at determined periods of time or can also be filled on-demand. It's essential to note that Oxfam's **"Country teams and partners are already providing lots of quantitative and qualitative data"**. This means, that NLP has sufficient data and criteria to categorize and filter issues based on their importance and urgence. In turn, this allows Oxfam to rank issues based their urgence and assign appropriate team of experts to solve them.

Another aspect of this project ensures that all the reported issues are archived in appropriate sections of the on-going projects and analyzed by AI through Machine Learning. With sufficient data, the AI can make accurate predictions about the projects in progress, and at the same time, Oxfam has sufficient data to organize and plan the necessary recourses to deploy on each project.
