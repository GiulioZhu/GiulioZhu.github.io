Hey, :wave:

I'm Giulio Zhu, a MEng Computer Science student at UCL.

I've programmed for nearly 4 years. My main language is Java, but I've used other languages such as Python and HTML. Currently, I'm aiming to become a Software Engineer, but throughout my college years I hope to learn more about Block Chain technology, Cloud Computing and Game Development (quite some unrelated fields huh?:thinking:).
