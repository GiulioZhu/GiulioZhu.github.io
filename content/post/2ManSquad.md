I encountered quite an unique situation in this project. Our team was a 2-man squad, so to speak.
<!--more-->

The project was to build an app that provided K-map (Karnaugh map) features and the user  . We were a group of 4 people, however, it was just me and my friend Holden Li to work on the project. One of the guys just told me to assign him easier parts so that he could avoid any programming. The other guy instead, just went idle, even though from what I've heard, he was very good at programming. We of course had meetings and assigned works to each other, however, only Holden and me carried out our tasks. 

At the end, Holden and I split the work: I did the front-end while he took care of the back-end, and we pushed the code to github. With some integration from my side, the program was then good to go. 

From this project I've become more accustomed to dealing with UIs on Java, and right now I'm fully capable of building apps/software from scratch.
