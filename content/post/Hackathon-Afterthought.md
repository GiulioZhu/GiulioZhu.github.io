UCL Induction Week's Hackathon provided an incredible opportunity to explore various non-profit organizations:
- OXFAM.
- International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC).
- Microsoft Philantropies (well, Microsoft technically isn't **non-profit** but it supports non profits).
- United Nation Alliance of NGOs and CSOs for South-South Cooperation (UN ANCSSC).

Thoughout the process, I collaborated with my team decided to solve Oxfam's Accountability issue. More info about the slide can be seen in my [portfolio](/portfolio/projects/hackathon)
