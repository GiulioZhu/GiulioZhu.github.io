During UCL's welcome week, I participated to multiple webinars and induction courses, one of which was hosted by Microsoft, and it was called **Microsoft Imagine Cup**. 

The webinar introduced *Microsoft Learn*, a platform that allows students to earn Microsoft certificates through the study of courses designed by Microsoft. After completing the required courses, students can take exams at designed test centers, and attempt to pass the exam. By passing the exam, students are awarded with the Microsoft certificate for the course that they studied, and a bit of ego boost:rofl:. Jk, the certificate gives you a legitimate aid in the application for jobs related to the certificate that you earn.

Anyway, so I started to take the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** course which then allows me to take the **AZ-900** exam. This course teaches about the concept of Cloud Computing and what Azure does in relation to it. I just noticed how brilliant Microsoft's business model is, since, they charge users based on the resourses they use by providing Cloud Computing Services, which includes Database, Machine Learning, VMs and Servers. This in turn, allows business to shift away from on-premise softwares and establish on the cloud. By doing so, business avoid building on-premise data centers and servers and save a lot of time, money and resources on maintaining the site. However, as a trade-off, business have to constantly pay the "rent" for Microsoft's services, which simply put, generates **passive income** for Microsoft. Of course, this is a **win-win situation** for Microsoft and its clients, which is why I said that this is a brilliant business model.
