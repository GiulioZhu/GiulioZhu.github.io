So in short, today I **deleted** the whole repo from which I edit and publish this website's contents. 
<!--more-->

What happened was that I was trying to figure out how to upload the Hugo files on GitHub and make it run. I've followed the tutorial on Hugo, GitHub and YT, and managed to get something on. However, I just didn't like how the repository was organized and proceded to delete the repository on GitHub (worst choice ever, be mindful of what you do, and don't be like me:sob:). Anyway, I just deleted the whole project and had to build the whole repoository again, but luckily OneDrive saved all my files (I don't know how, but I guess they were backed up on the Cloud:relieved:). **Having files on the Cloud can really save ur life one day**, so be sure to regularly backup files and be more careful when managing GitHub repos.
