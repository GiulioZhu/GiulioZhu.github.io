This is story.:scroll:

I've started programming during the end of my freshmen year in high school. At that time, I programmed with Scratch. The logic of coding was so straight forward that I grasped the concept immediately:grin:. Later on, during my sophomore year, I upped my programming level, took a programming class with python and self-studied Java. During my junior year I still self-studied Java and in my senior year, I took the AP Computer Science A class, which was based on Java. Obviously, I nailed the test:wink:, but up until now, I still love the Object Oriented Programming concept introduced in Java, and I'm still applying them to my programs. Tbh, it makes your program look cleaner:sunglasses:.

Currently, I'm a part-time web editor for Italian Chinese Theological Seminary [ICTS](https://www.itcts.org)
